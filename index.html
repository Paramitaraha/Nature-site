        <h2>Hello Summer</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone loves summer, because it is the best time to go on vacation,
          spend time near the sea and sunbathing. It is a great time for doing
          some sports outdoors, spending time with families and friends.
          Everyone feels happier in this time of year, because you do not need
          to wear warm clothes and can go for a walk even in the night time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this time of the year, days become warm, hot and really long, while
          nights in this season are the shortest.
        </p>
        <p>
          summer season is full of color, everything around is flourishing, the
          birds are singing and you can feel that the nature around you is
          lining!
